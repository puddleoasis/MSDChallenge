MSDChallenge [WIP]
============

# Abstract #
The Million Song Dataset Challenge is a largescale, personalized music recommendation challenge, where the goal is to predict the songs that a user will listen to, given both the user's listening history and full content-based information for all songs.
We implement and report results for both user-based and item-based collaborative filtering algorithms and suggest approaches to combine these models to improve further recommendation.

# Function #
This repository provides the ability to create recommendations for, and evaluation those recommendations for the The Million Song Dataset Challenge as presented by McFee, Brian and Bertin-Mahieux, Thierry and Ellis, Daniel P.W. and Lanckriet, Gert R.G. in "The Million Song Dataset Challenge."

## main.py ##
main.py generate_prediction[s] for users based on the recommender, and writes them to a file. main.py presently generates correct predictions for ItemBasedPredictions, while the UserBasedPredictions scoring is presently not functioning correctly.

## truncated_map.py ##
truncated_map.py evaluates predictions generated by main.py.
Because these recommendations take a long time to evaluate, we have generated the relevant files which can be found in the generatedRecommendations/ folder.
